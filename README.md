Objectives

* Understand the fundamental building blocks of all programming languages: variables, arrays, conditionals, loops, and functions.
* Create simple VBA macros to trigger pop ups and change cell values.
* Gain practice in writing VBA subroutines that utilize variables and conditionals.
* Begin to develop essential coding skills of syntax recollection, pattern recognition, problem decomposition, and debugging.
* Understand the basic syntax of a VBA for loop.
* Understand how to utilize for-loops in conjunction with conditionals to direct logic flow.
* Understand the value of a nested for-loop and gain basic proficiency in their use.
* Refine fundamental coding skills (syntax recollection, pattern recognition, problem decomposition, and debugging).
* Be comfortable formatting spreadsheets using VBA code.
* Understand how to loop through a table using VBA code and check for changes in values.

- - -Instructions

* Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

* You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

* The result should look as follows.

### CHALLENGES

1. Your solution will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume". The solution will look as follows:

2. Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.

Make sure that the script acts the same on each sheet. The joy of VBA is to take the tediousness out of repetitive task and run over and over again with a click of the button.
